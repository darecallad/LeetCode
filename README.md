Daily LeetCode Practice
Welcome to my daily LeetCode practice section! In this section, I'll provide an overview of how I approach and engage in daily LeetCode problem-solving to enhance my algorithmic skills and coding proficiency.

Purpose
The primary goal of this daily practice is to consistently challenge myself with algorithmic problems and improve my problem-solving abilities. By dedicating a portion of my day to LeetCode, I aim to:

Strengthen my understanding of different algorithms and data structures.
Enhance my coding skills in various programming languages.
Explore and learn multiple approaches to solving complex problems.
Build a strong foundation for technical interviews and coding assessments.
Process
Problem Selection: Each day, I choose one or more LeetCode problems to solve. I ensure that I select problems of varying difficulty levels to cover a wide range of topics and challenges.

Understanding the Problem: Before jumping into coding, I read and understand the problem statement thoroughly. I analyze the input/output requirements, constraints, and special cases.

Algorithm Design: I brainstorm and design possible algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. I consider various approaches such as brute force, optimized algorithms, and dynamic programming.

Coding: With the algorithm in mind, I start implementing the solution in my preferred programming language. I focus on writing clean, organized, and well-documented code.

Testing: I test my code with different test cases, including edge cases and corner cases. I ensure that the code produces the expected outputs for each scenario.

Optimization: If the initial solution can be optimized further, I explore alternatives and make improvements to enhance performance.

Submission: Once I'm satisfied with the code and it passes all test cases, I submit it on LeetCode. This step is crucial for verification and feedback.

Learning: After submission, I review the discussions and solutions provided by other LeetCode users. I learn from their approaches, discover new techniques, and gain insights into alternative solutions.

Benefits
This consistent practice of solving LeetCode problems has significantly improved my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. It has not only helped me prepare for technical interviews but has also enhanced my confidence in tackling real-world coding challenges.

By documenting my journey in this "readme" file, I hope to share my experiences and inspire others to embark on their own daily LeetCode practice journeys.
